# A week on Soylent

A few months ago, I was looking up for any food that would be a complete meal replacement. Me being a college student had to soon leave the comfort of my dorm and go to another state for the summer. I was never a advocate of food and would always find ways to avoid food.  

## Day 1
- Soylent at 1pm
- hungry by 5
- tried to sip big gulps almost threw up
- has a muffin after 6pm
- another soylent at 8pm
-
