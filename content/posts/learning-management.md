Recently I came across this wonderful book by Andrew Grove called "High Output Management". Andrew Grove was the founder and CEO of Intel.

I think everyone should read this book even if you're not a manager. I've read management textbooks while in college, and this is not one of those books. Grove explains from first principles and illustrates how to think about management with fun analogy. He also shows you what kind of framework you need for thinking about management. I'm just half way in but found this is one of the best books I've read on the subject so far.

If you're the tech industry, even as a engineer like me, I highly recommend this book.
