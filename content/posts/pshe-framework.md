Ever since I heard about the [PSHE framework](https://youtu.be/MopkTrQMx1A?t=2986) by Shishir Mehrotra. I have been using it a lot and also thinking about how it is applicable to different kind of problems.

A lot of you may already have some framework or process like this, hopefully if you don't this will provide you one.

* * *

The PSHE model was used at Youtube for figuring out whether someone is a senior or junior, should they be promoted, and if not what do they need to work on. This is also what a lot of promotion committees within Google use to compare different job levels and expectations.
PSHE is short for Problem, Solution, How, and Execution. In short,  
- You have a junior product manager who starts at the right, they are handed everything, the problem, solution, and a plan on the how, and their job is to take that and just become an **executing powerhouse**.
- As they advance, now they are just given a problem and solution and have to figure out the **how**. This would be like the milestones, roadmap, what teams to bring together, what meetings to hold, and so on. 
- As they advance further, now they are given a problem and will need to figure out the **solution**. They need to develop a way to solve that hard problem.
- And at some point, as they get even more advanced, they are just handed a space and have to find the **right problems** to solve.

So PSHE framework is basically used to determine levels at a company. But in a similar way, you could also use it to think about how you are going to think about developing a product.
- (P)roblem: First think about what is the problem that you are trying to solve? Who are you solving it for?
- (S)olution: What would the ideal solution be? Who would use it? What would it look like? 
- (H)ow: What are the actual steps we have to follow to get to this solution? Who do I need? What do I need to build?
- (E)xecution: This is the actual work where you spend 99% of the time. Building, iterating, launching, talking to users, incorporating feedback, and going back to the how.


If you look more closely into the specific word choices, you will see that you can think about startups in the same fashion, you see that there is a parallel:
- Problem / Mission: What is the hard problem that you are so compelled by that needs to be solved and who are you solving it for? This mission is the defining thing that brings together people to work with you in a startup to solve it. You should ideally become a "mission-driven" startup.
- Solution / Vision: Again what does the ideal product that solves it looks like. If there ever was an end-goal for the company, this would be it. The vision is not what you operationalize around, it is the thing you want to achieve.
- Strategy / How (high-level): Strategy comes from set of principles that guide you while building a product. There are two components to it: external and internal. The external can be thought of the data about the market, and the constraints that bind you (physical, laws, rules). The external is what you cannot control and therefore you must have researched to all extents possible. The internal is your own preferences and assumptions. You set out to solve this problem, so you have your own idea about what it should be.
- Roadmap / How (low-level): This is the manifestation of the strategy. This is where you actually implement them into achievable goals, milestones, steps. You build a timeline. Think about who to meet, who to bring together, what to write, what to code, and how to build it.
- Execution: This again is the hard work of building, iterating, launching, talking to users, incorporating feedback. Whatever you learn here is new data from the outside world, and also listening to users will make you rethink your initial assumptions, so this all goes upstream to strategy.



Thinking more about this I realized the PSHE framework is even more general. I was reading about [design doc at google](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/). If you are designing a design doc for a software product, you can draw parallels and follow similar steps to think about it:
- Problem / Context and Scope: What is the environment in which we are building this new product.
- Solution / Goals: what are the goals of the system. What do we want to build? What are we not building?
- How / Actual system design: Here you actually define the details of what you are building. How it is going to work? Think deep enough about the different trade-offs and write them down. Be strategic. Include all the stuff from system context to APIS to data storage to the algorithms you might use. 
- Execute: Here we actually code it out.

Recently I read another piece about good strategies and someone [commented](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21782892) an idea from this book, [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-difference-matters/dp/1781256179/ref=asc_df_1781256179/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312407247347&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11383423260188233305&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031928&hvtargid=pla-566591824724&psc=1), and
while I haven't read the book yet, their point was that a strategy consists of:
1. An understanding of the core problem and what opportunity there is to solve it
2. An idea about how to go about solving it, what are your principles, how to respond
3. A detailed implementation of the ideas with concrete actionable steps

And there you see that it has a pretty good resemblance with the PSHE model. So you can use a similar mental muscle to reason about strategy too.

This PSHE model is a pretty generic model on how to think ahead, be strategic and write things down in clear language. Hopefully, with the small examples illustrated here, someone finds it very helpful in their work. 

I also believe there is tons of opportunity for you to take this model and modify, add to it, mold it to your current requirements.

*Thank you for reading!*

**Update:**
My personal PSHE framework has now evolved a bit. Here is how it looks like:
- Problem 
  + the mission. measurable, realizable. inspirational.
- Solution
  + vision. something to reach for. do not operationalize.
  + look for an addressable market. opportunity.
- How
  + think strategy. include external(constraints & data) and internal(assumptions and preferences)
  + build out the strategy into a more well-defined roadmap.
  + prioritize. have measurable objectives.
  + if startup, build culture, and values.
- Execute
  + build fast. iterate quickly. 
  + launch earliest. 
  + talk to users.
  + take feedback. think on it. reiterate strategy.
