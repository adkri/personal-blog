Hi there! I'm Amit. I am a software engineer.

<img style="float: left;margin-right:30px;" src="https://i.ibb.co/X8BKXWt/profile-zoom-2x.jpg" width="250">
I like to develop, optimize and take care of complex backend systems.

I often love to deep dive into systems programming, tackling away at abstractions to know what I'm working with and leverage systems from the bottom up.


I go to a small town liberal arts college around the midwest.
